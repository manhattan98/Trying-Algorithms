# Trying-Algorithms
my study project where i trained implementing various algorithms, data structures, and solving some problems in Java. i also read book "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" by R. Lafore when writing this project.

in this project i implemented:
- linked list and array list, comforming to java List interface
- binary trees
- graphs and common algorithms: BFS, DFS, MST
- hash map with double hash probe, comforming to java Map interface
- implemented some sorting algorithms
- deque, comforming to java Deque interface
- tree 2-3
